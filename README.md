## About the Project ü•±
<div align="center">
    <p align="justify"> 
      In today's fast-paced world, convenience is key, and this holds true for shopping experiences as well. One common inconvenience faced by shoppers is long queues at checkout counters in supermarkets and stores. This not only wastes customers' time but also ties up valuable labor resources for businesses. In response to this problem, we propose the implementation of a Self-Checkout system, powered advanced technologies, aimed at making the shopping experience smoother and more efficient.
    </p>
</div>

## Aims & Objectives üò≤
* To Create a mobile application that allows customers to easily scan and purchase products using their smartphones.

* To Incorporate a flutter barcode scanning package that allows customers to accurately identify and add products to their virtual cart.

* To Develop an Algorithm that can analyze customers' product choices and suggest similar items, enhancing the shopping experience and encouraging upselling.

* To Integrate Personalized recommendations that can analyze forgotten items on products based on customer‚Äôs past history.

* When skipping the queue and using self-checkout technology, getting a paper receipt seems old-fashioned and like a waste of time, you are trying to save which is not only a sustainable alternative to paper but can be issued promptly and without additional effort or waiting time.
